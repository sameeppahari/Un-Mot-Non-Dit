                <h3>📍 Day 1: The Moment That Started It All</h3>
                <p>I still remember the first time I saw you at MUN, confidently asking a question. I was supposed to be prepared, but instead, I fumbled. And there you were—smiling, giggling at my little mess-up. Maybe that was the moment I lost my case in MUN, but unknowingly, I think I started losing my heart too.</p>

                <h3>📍 Day 2: The First Conversation</h3>
                <p>The next day, we talked. It wasn’t just any conversation; it felt like I’d known you forever. There was something about the way you spoke, the way you made things seem lighter, easier.</p>

            <div class="entry">
                <h3>📍 The Chairperson’s Question</h3>
                <p>"Are you both dating?"—That one moment when the entire committee turned towards us. We laughed it off, but deep down, a part of me wished it wasn’t just a joke.</p>

            <div class="entry">
                <h3>📍 The Tag That Stuck: "Senior Sahab"</h3>
                <p>"Senior Sahab"—a title I never asked for but now, I don’t want to lose. Every time you say it, it does something to me. It's like a slow poison, but the kind that I don’t mind drinking every day.</p>

            <div class="entry">
                <h3>📍 The Jealousy Moment</h3>
                <p>Then came the day when you said, "I have to meet that friend today." I don’t know why, but something in me shifted. A feeling I didn’t want to admit to myself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="entry">
                <h3>📍 And Today…</h3>
                <p>Now, here I am, writing this, knowing that maybe you haven’t even thought about all these moments the way I have. But I had to say it.</p>
